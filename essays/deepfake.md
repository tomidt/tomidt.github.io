## Deepfakes and the Future

Deepfakes are a rapidly improving technology that has taken over the mainstream spotlights. Deepfakes are a computer generated media usually through artificial intelligence, that can depict subjects doing things or saying things they never did. With the rapidly developing technology of AI, deepfakes are now reasonably accessible to the public. This brings into question the impact they will have in the future.

Deepfakes are powerful. Given a large enough dataset, they can make anyone say anything. This ability to spread misinformation is basically unlimited. This however, is not the first time this leap in misinformation happened. A similar thing happened when photoshop was made accessible to the general public. Nowadays, it is a given that photos can be edited. Seeing a photo of an elephant with wings does not mean that an elephant with wings actually exists. This will be needed with videos too. Deepfaking is just the next step of photoshop.

When technology advances further to let anyone say anything they want, the mindset will also need to advance. Just as we do not believe pictures of words of anything we say, the same must be said about videos. Now that the technology is out, it is impossible to go back.
