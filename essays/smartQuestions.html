  <h3 id="what">What</h3>

<p>A smart question is one that is clear and concise. In the question, it should be clear what is being asked and other background information. For example, asking questions about your computer hardware, it is important to provide all of the specs of your setup. A smart question is also well researched. This means that it is not a question that has been asked previously with the answer easily findable with a single search.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>Smart questions are important for having clear and efficient communication. Describing problems in a way that easily allows others to understand the issue, eliminates any wasted time in misunderstandings. Asking smart questions also shows that you put in some effort. Showing that you put in time and thought before you asked the question will make others more likely to respond and help you out.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<p>An example of a bad question is, “Why is my code working”, followed by a copy and paste of the entire file. This is not a smart question because there is no direction to the question. The question does not contain the intending behavior that you are trying to achieve. The question also does not show you took any initiative to solve it yourself. The question does not provide any follow up to where the problem might be and other parts that work fine. This is a very bad question.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p>An example of a good question was asked on Stack Overflow. This question has the author asking why processing a sorted array is faster than processing an unsorted array. To start with, the question is much more focused than the previous question. In addition to this, the author provided details proving the problem. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array</p>
