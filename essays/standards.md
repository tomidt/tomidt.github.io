## Coding Standard Reflection

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/download.png">

After the first week of using the ESLint coding standards in my Javascript code, my impression of it is very mixed. Coding standards are a set of rules to follow that makes code standardized. This standardization allows for other developers to easily understand your code at a glance. It also makes the code more readable for you to understand. Finally, coding standards can also reduce the chances of you making errors in your code.

My opinion on coding standards is mixed because it greatly slows down my coding speed. I already am not the fastest coder, but going back and fixing minute errors like spacing is extremely annoying. ESLint is extremely strict on spacing in everything and it does not align with how I normally code. This means that I constantly have errors about things that I do not see as errors. Despite this, I still see the benefit in adhering to coding standards. It might be easy for me to understand my code, but the same might not be said for others. I believe that it is also a good skill to learn to adapt to different ways of coding. At jobs, it might be enforced to code a certain way. With the experience of using ESLint I would be able to enforce a coding standard on my IDE.

Overall, the benefits of using a coding standard greatly outweighs the negatives. Coding speed will increase with time as I get used to adhering the standards. Eventually, I will not make errors with spacing at all. This will mean that I do not lose any speed and gain the benefit of having coding standards.
