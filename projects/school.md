This was a project I started in my senior year of highschool. It was my last year at the school, and I started the project as a memento for my future self to look back on. I worked on it all throughout the year to finish all of the classrooms and facilities. The terrain and extra detailing are lacking but the project was completed by the time I graduated. [A look at the actual school](https://www.pchs.k12.hi.us/).
